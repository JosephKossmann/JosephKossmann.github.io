Been having issues with github, but slowly working through it, plan to lay down the basics from the tutorials whilst changing it in my own way, have yet to decide what exactly to focus on.

Was working on a version of snake based on work from previous years on my own repository, unaware that there was a repository with a basic template readily available, so I switched over to that one and continued to integrate the existing code with code based on previouus C++ games

<b>POST MORTEM</b>

Overall I would say that my iteration of Snake was not a successful one, for while the UI worked absolutely fine and the level was functioning (the player can't escape it's confines but could move within it) the snake growing mechanic only worked once, and movement is not continuous as is usual of snake, and was more of a "press to move a certain distance" sort of control scheme. 

If I had dedicated myself a bit more I would have not only set up the basics of the game a bit more, such as a more snake like movement, consumption of white bits made the snake grow in size, and touching itself or the wall would cause a game over, but I would have also looked into variations of the snake game format; a second player for local co-op could have been added for a slight change in gameplay, scoreboards to see how well you did in a certain run, which in conjungtion with the previous idea would have induced a more competitive angle to the game. These ideas, however, are not terribly unique, so I would have looked into truly adventurous, if a bit wildly difficult, ideas such as a larger, more open world level, similar to slither.io, perhaps add other obstacles or even AI enemies to up the difficulty, although in this version the win state would be different to the original, as it would be nigh impossible to fill out the entirety of the world with yourself.

In conclusion, I don't expect to do so well with the snake game I have created, but at least I have now become confident enough to both code more readily and speedily, although that didn't always help this time around.
